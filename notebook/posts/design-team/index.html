          <p><strong>first leadership experience in princeton:</strong> daunting, but rewarding. excited to pass it on.</p>        </div>
      

              <div class="post-content">
          <p>when i think about <strong>leadership at princeton</strong>, i'll always think of the <strong>e-club design team</strong>. i'll always remember how daunting it was when i was first selected as the director for the design team. i wasn't very familiar with design at the time, so i felt extremely underqualified for the role. however, after reassurance from my previous co-directors, and a training meeting that laid out all the future responsibilities, i realized that even if i didn't feel very prepared, i would have to at least present myself as prepared.</p>
<p>when sophomore year started, i was launched into the position, and had to advertise our club (which required a lot of standing around in the activities fair and trying to get people to come to our booth, which was scary). i then began the actual meetings, communications, etc. it was new, but somehow, it also felt refreshing and rewarding. i enjoyed that i felt like i was completing a lot of tasks, being productive, meeting new people, and of course, designing. fast forward to now, we're about to wrap up activities after concluding our annual competition, which was organized mainly by my co-director and i.</p>

<p>i'm really grateful to be able to have met so many people through my team: they're all extremely hard-working, talented, and committed. i'm happy they chose to stick with my co-director and i throughout this entire year, especially since so many of them are freshmen who are just adjusting to college life. i'm happy for their trust in my co-director and i's leadership. and of course, i'm extremely thankful for my co-director. yuki is not only an incredible designer, she's an amazing person to work with, and we work together perfectly. i'm also extremely grateful for my previous co-directors. they served as role models to teach yuki &amp; i, and they also helped us this year as well.</p>
<p>though i was afraid at first, i think sophomore year would be a lot different if i wasn't a part of the design team. i wouldn't have met so many people, i wouldn't have signed up for design nation, i wouldn't have been able to create so many designs, and i wouldn't have been able to design for nonprofits this upcoming summer. </p>
