          <p>it somehow feels exciting to give somebody a tour of a city that you know as home. in a way, it almost gets you more excited too.</p>        </div>

<p>on december 15th, 2024, i went to new york city with a friend. it was reading period, and we were excited to go on a small trip together, especially since princeton is so close to new york. this friend hadn't gone to new york before by herself—she's gone with family, but that meant that destinations were chosen by her family and not necessarily herself. i know that part of it is because new york city is <strong>my home</strong>, but i was shocked to hear that someone from new jersey hasn't ever gone to new york by themself. i had this image in my head that a lot of people from jersey typically went to new york on the weekends, or that it was at least a spot that was somewhat familiar.</p>
<p>being that it was my friend's first time, i wanted to make it worthwhile, but also authentic. as somebody who went to high school in new york city, i think i had a high school experience that many people who idolize new york citymight envy. my school was located in tribeca, with a perfect view of the freedom tower. i was close to many of the shopping districts, a train ride away from central park or the MET, and honestly, i've taken that accessibility for granted. when my friend came, i wanted her to sort of have the "day in the life" experience, instead of only focusing on the "conventional" tourist spots (though what isn't a tourist spot when it comes to new york city?) (though yes, we went to central park and times square). </p>

<p>we also walked around 23-28th streets, and shopped a little in soho. it was genuinely very fun! my friend was being introduced to new experiences and i think that feeling transferred to me as well. i felt as if i was experiencing the city through a new lens, and that felt magical to me. i even did stuff i hadn't done before, such as going to a photobooth. it truly was so fun, and changed how i viewed new york. i really want to go back with friends during the school year because it's such a different feeling.</p>        </div>
