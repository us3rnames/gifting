<p>in 24 hours, whitman room draw will have occurred and i want to update this after it does. i have zero idea what will happen and i'm aiming to hopefully get a single. however, my time is not great, and i doubt i will actually get a room i want. on top of that, i'm also drawing by myself, which means that i won't be able to claim a room that isn't a single. i'm actually so scared and i have no idea what will happen.</p>
<p>update: there were no more rooms in whitman. i have been officially placed into upperclassmen housing. obviously, i was upset, but honestly, i'm still optimistic. i found a group that i can draw with for upperclassmen housing and i think i'm going to try for a triple, so that we can have three singles by turning the common room into a single. i'm excited to live with people, honestly. i'm so used to living by myself, and while that provides me with a lot of comfort and freedom, i also think it takes away some of the discipline that i used to have because i'm no longer working around anybody's schedule. however, having a single but still having roommates might provide me with the structure that i need in life. :)</p>        </div>
