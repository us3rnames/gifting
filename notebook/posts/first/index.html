              <div class="post-content">
          <p>welcome to my first post! this documents my first addition to my memory site, and i hope that this memory site can continue to be updated over time.</p>
<p>we're currently around 2-3 months into the semester, and the semester seems to have gone by so quickly. at this point in the semester, i feel as though i'm lacking motivation and drive. recently, it's been difficult for me to feel inspired, but i'm trying to push through. i believe that inspiration is only an optional factor in the process of creating something, so i'm hoping i can still create a memory site that is a reflection of the vision i have in my head. </p>
<p>though i feel a little burnt out from the semester, march has been such a <strong>long and fulfilling month.</strong> i spent so much time with people i love, and i also feel like i'm strengthening a lot of my connections. also, i seem to have lost motivation, but i'm still passionate about a lot of the things i want to do. i've become a lot more ambitious, and it feels amazing to be ambitious again. however, one thing i've been telling myself is that it actually takes effort to reach my ambitions. i've been feeling randomly tired, and just don't think i'm putting in as much effort as i can. i hope to change that and i recognize that it'll require putting in a lot of work. </p>
<p>recently, i've been spending a lot of time listening to the deluxe tracks off eternal sunshine. they've been really growing on me, and though not directly applicable, i still feel a lot of connection to the lyrics. one song i've been listening to is the extended version of the intro of the album. </p>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5BBkvXH2jYROUzKIB7WX7S?si=0293e3f636e142ae">open.spotify.com/track/5BBkvXH2jYROUzKIB7WX7S</a></p>
<p>i've been satisfied with my friendships recently. i think i'm making a lot of progress in terms of talking to people and learning how to be more confident when i speak. i subconsciously speak quietly and though i don't think it's to the extent of every action, i tend to be self conscious of "awkward" moments. however, recently, i've been able to express myself in a way that feels synonymous to myself which makes me happy.</p>
<p>room draw, on the other hand, is upsetting me. i drew by myself and i don't have a lot of hope in getting a single again. ultimately, that's what i really want, but i'm okay with living with roommates too. it's just that i'll probably have to join a waitlist because i won't be able to get a quad/double by myself (since i drew by myself.) <figure><img alt="" src="/media/pages/posts/first/fa19abf4b3-1743536526/mood.png"></figure></p>        </div>
