<p>if you saw my firestone post, you would know that i'm currently sitting in firestone working on this assignment. i'm procrastinating on my cos assignment that is due tonight. to be honest, i do have a lot done, so i'm in better shape than i have been in previous weeks, but i also have a programming exam on wednesday that i'm stressed about. a lot of people have been attempting to reassure me, telling me that it's not too difficult, but it's hard to believe because i currently feel like i don't have any actual mastery of any of the skills necessary for this class.</p>
<p>i understand the concepts, and when the APIs are laid out for me, i can complete them, but it's hard to me to write code on my own given just instructions. i think understanding the instructions and translating them into code is also hard for me. while i understand the functions of code if you were to give me code, synthesizing becomes super difficult. i want to work hard though—i know that if i put in the effort, i can definitely succeed on this exam. i'm going to finish some more memory posts, and then dedicate the rest of today to cos. honestly, i'm proud of myself because i don't think i typically would have this much work done if i wasn't in firestone working. so, round of applause to myself for putting in the effort to show up for myself. it takes 21 days to create a hobby, so as long as i can keep putting in the effort, i'm sure i can become a version of myself that i am more proud of.</p>        </div>
