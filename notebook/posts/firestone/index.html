<p>i'm writing this from firestone library. i typically do not go to firestone at ALL. even during midterms or finals week, i've always avoided firestone. in my head, i believe firestone is sort of the final "okay, i have to really be responsible for myself and do work" sort of "location." i avoid it because honestly, i haven't really been into working hard recently. i don't want to blame burnout even though i know that may be a fully valid reason because i believe that i've been "burnt out" for so long. i haven't had the same work ethic ever since quarantine. during quarantine, i was really good with getting my work done in time, and i was always on top of all my assignments.</p>
<p>nowadays, while i get my assignments done on time, i don't think it excites me the same way that i used to. i don't get the same dopamine rush that being productive used to give me. now, all my assignments feel like a heavy responsibility rather than something fun to check off my to-do list. however, i've realized how important it is to actually hold myself accountable for my own work. i'm tired of avoiding my work and then feeling unproductive and horrible after i spend my time on social media, playing games, or doing anything to avoid focusing on my academics.</p>
<p>i still love the feeling of academic validation too, so by not doing my work, i put myself in a self-sabotaging position where i know that i'm not putting in enough to effort to obtain the results i want. so here i am at firestone, with my headphones in, typing on my laptop. (frankly, i'm working on this assignment to avoid doing my cos assignment, but hey, that's better than doing nothing, which i probably would be doing had this been a typical sunday!) </p>
<p>i'm trying to change my "typical weekends" from ones of doing nothing productive to ones of getting work done (but still a healthy amount to give myself rest), eating and sleeping well, working out, and possibly keeping my space and myself clean. maybe going to firestone today represents a turning point in my current college mindset..?</p>        </div>
