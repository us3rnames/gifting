          <p>i felt like i had to document this somewhere, and i haven't opened my physical journal yet, so why not my digital journal?</p>
<p>while there exists a plethora of self-help knowledge out there, actually putting it into use is tricky. it's easy to convince yourself to stick something out in hopes that maybe, love will happen. it's convenient to tell yourself that inconsistent text messages happen all the time. when i was going through this talking stage, i had this hope budding in my heart that maybe something would come out of it. in hindsight, i'm not upset at myself for thinking this way, though it's so easy to say it is. no, i accept my feelings at that time. i accept that i put my effort into something i found meaningful. </p>
<p>i also don't think that this is a situation where i can blame the other person. things happen all the time. sometimes, people may not be able to communicate how they really feel. i want to say what i believe, and i want to say what i think was in his head, but the truth is, i don't know. i don't know what he was thinking. i can't take out a tool to measure how genuine his messages were. i can't find out his intentions. i don't think i'll ever know.</p>
<p>i didn't feel comfortable breaking it off at the time that i did, but i did. i was in a bad mood, and just realized that maybe a talking stage that is going in the right direction shouldn't bring me this much stress. i respect him for taking it so kindly. though he removed me on socials, i think i understand. it's easy to take that as an attack, but i understand: our relationship to each other was temporary. we no longer have reason to stay in touch: how would our friendship truly work out anyway?</p>
<p>sometimes, i find myself getting hopeful again that maybe somehow, our paths will cross again. i can accept those feelings, but i cannot embrace them. by writing this post, i'm establishing where i stand on this. thank you for your place in my life, no matter how ephemeral it was.</p>        </div>
