<p>i've always loved cities. as somebody who grew up in new york, i always found myself loving city life. the accessibility of everything, especially cities where walking is one of the most common forms of transportation, is extremely appealing to me.</p>
<p>i decided to go to boston over spring break to visit two of my friends who go to tufts and harvard. i was extremely excited because 1.) i haven't seen my friends in a long time, and 2.) i was excited to be in a new city. i love new york city, but i wanted to see something new, and i would be getting to explore not just downtown boston, but also medford and cambridge.</p>
<p>i left on a saturday, and i took the train to new york penn station in order to catch the bus. i remember that i was pretty confident in the bus system, only for my friend to tell me that sometimes the buses come two hours past their set time... which made me anxious. luckily though, that didn't happen! i got on the bus around 12:30 and got myself ready for the four hour commute. however, i found out when i got on that i had left the charging brick for my phone charger in my dorm, meaning i only had the wire. my phone was under 10% and the bus's usb ports didn't work. my phone was still losing battery charge, and i was afraid that my phone would die before i got to boston. while my ipad was fully charged, i didn't have wifi. while this was stressful, it did mean i had to think of ways to keep myself entertained on the bus ride. i didn't have music, so i ended up sleeping for about half the ride. the other half was just spent staring outside the window and thinking. somehow, the ride felt really short (way shorter than my ride back) even though i didn't have my phone.</p>
<p>when i got there, i first went to tufts. my friend picked me up from a bakery, and we headed over to her dorm. i was obsessed! i really loved that she lived in an apartment-style dorm, which isn't very common at princeton. we ate for a little, and then headed out to a cultural event and an art exhibition, which were both super fun! i got to meet a few new people, and i'm even still connected on social media with one of the people i met. i found it a bit difficult to connect with people at some events because i wasn't really sure what to say past "hi i'm ___'s friend from home." i find being social kind of exhausting sometimes so i would just say hi and leave it at that. however, i did still enjoy being present at the events. i then went to tufts' version of "late meal" which was super fun!!! i felt like i was a student without the academic stress. i then went back to tufts, and talked to my friend's roommates—they were interested in princeton's eating club culture, which i probably spent about an hour debriefing. i then spent the next day also going to a cultural event—i didn't really get to know people beyond introductions but it was still enjoyable. at night, i left for harvard.</p>

<p>harvard was also super fun. the dorm reminded me a lot more of princeton, and the first night that i was there, i was involved in a video for one of harvard's different houses. both my friends are super involved in their schools/clubs/extracurriculars/etc. (a quality i really admire) so i got to be parts of really cool things. by this point, it was a sunday, so my friends had classes and other things, but i spent monday going outside into downtown boston and purchasing my friend a gift. when i went back to the dorm, my friend took me on a tour of cambridge (which was beautiful!) and we ended up doing some work. i also spent some time with a third friend who goes to harvard (but is friends with the aforementioned harvard friend): we all went to get waffles together and it was amazing to be able to catch up. tuesday was my friend's birthday (YAY!!!) so we went to get brunch together and then i spent time doing work with my friend around four. i caught the 5:30 train and got back to new york city around 9. </p>

<p>overall, boston was so fun. i definitely want to be back someday. i wish people would come visit princeton too, but i honestly understand why they don't.</p>        </div>
