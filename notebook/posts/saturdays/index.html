          <p>there's a certain feeling about saturday that i can't shake. recently, it's been the feeling of disappointment. every friday before saturday, i sleep late because i choose to call a friend and play games. while i do truly appreciate being able to talk to my friend (who is in hong kong, thus having a 12 hour time different between us), it usually ends up with me sleeping extremely late. (around 3-4am): this means that when i wake up on saturday, i'm not feeling extremely refreshed, and a large chunk of the day has already passed.</p>
<p>this effect usually impacts my whole day. my first meal is pushed a little back, i have low energy levels throughout the day, and for some reason, i can't get myself to do work for most of saturday. i do have a shift on saturdays from 7-9pm at the library, and i typically spend some of that time doing work. however, to be honest, doing work on saturdays is rare for me, and it makes me feel disappointed in myself. it's so easy to have an ideal schedule in your head, but implementing that schedule proves to be so difficult. i'm stuck in a loop where i tell myself that something will change, but nothing ever does. i know that thoughts are only the first step: while i can formulate a plan in my head, it doesn't exist in the universe until i actually execute it. i feel like i often seek the quick enjoyment and happiness when it comes to my sleep schedule, meaning i sacrifice my sleep to enjoy more "along" and "enjoyment" time. however, this usually causes me to feel terrible both mentally and physically after. finding a balance is hard.</p>
<p>i think this theme has been something that i've been struggling with in life. i hate the feeling of being stuck in a loop, but yet, it feels so hard to get out of...? i don't want to face the feeling of making zero progress in the fields that i want to make progress in. i want to say i'll try and i'll put in more effort, but what does that truly mean until i make it happen?</p>        </div>
