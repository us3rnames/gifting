    <p class="center">this was a trip to new york that i took with my friend who hasn't been in a while. it was soooo fun</p>
    <p class="center">udon lab! this was my first time trying it and i tried one of their most popular dishes. 
      i thought it was really good, but it was a lot of flavors at once.</p>
    <p class="center">i think this was their bacon spicy noodles but i'm not too sure (sorry) </p>
    
      <p class = "center">because of that, i would give it a <strong>4.5 out of five.</strong> 
        but i actually went back and their other dishes were awesome too!!!
        ★★★★ + 1/2 * ★ </p>
