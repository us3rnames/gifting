     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%"> as someone from new york city who attends a school so close to new york, i realize that
      many people who go may wonder what restaurants they should go to. i wanted to create a guide of my favorite
      places, which gives a holistic consideration of the vibe, price, food, etc! 
      <br>
      <br>
      i hope you enjoy! (also please feel free to disagree with me)

     <p><b><h3>üìç: 5av 52st, brooklyn ny</h3></b></p>
     <p class = "center" style = "width: 90%">these birria tacos are from a food cart in sunset park, brooklyn.
      i loveeeed these, and i think they're also super worth it for the price (one taco was about $3.50
      and the size is shown in the image. i believe they're super tender and amazing. 
      would love to hear what you think if you try it! </p>
     <p class = "center"><b>my personal rating: five out of five ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ</b></p>

     <p><b><h3>üìç: chelsea market, manhattan ny</h3></b></p>
     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%">i had this sandwich in chelsea market and i <strong>do not</strong> know where it is now and it was so good it was expensive but still so good. 
      since chelsea market often rotates out their restaurants, i'm not sure whether this one is still up. however
      i think the price was a bit high (around $14). </p>
     <p class="center" ><b>four out of five ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ </b></p>
     <img class="center image" src="sandwich.JPG" width = 200 height = 250>
     <p><b><h3>üìç: oh-k dog, flushing queens, ny</h3></b></p>
     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%">corn dogs are one of my favorite snacks. forever. this corn dog was
      good but i didn't think it was anything extremely special. i think you can get a corn dog like
      this from many different types of corn dog places. however, since it was still very solid,
      and the price and quality were both good, i would give it a four out of five. definitely
      try it if you're in the area!</p>

    <p><b><h3>üóìÔ∏è date: 12/15/2024</h3></b></p>
    <p class="center" style = "width: 90%">this was a trip to new york that i took with my friend who hasn't been in a while. it was soooo fun
    udon lab! this was my first time trying it and i tried one of their most popular dishes. i thought it was really good, but it was a lot of flavors at once.
    i think this was their bacon spicy noodles but i'm not too sure (sorry) </p>
    
      <p class = "center" style = "width: 90%">because of that, i would give it a <strong>4.5 out of five.</strong> 
        but i actually went back and their other dishes were awesome too!!! so honestly choose something that suits your tastes!

    <p><b><h3>üóìÔ∏è date: (went too many times to remember a specific time)</h3></b></p>
    <p class = "center" style = "width: 90%">TAIWAN PORK CHOP HOUSE! i love this place, i go every time i'm in Chinatown. they're closed
      on Tuesdays so keep that in mind. i don't have a picture specifically but that just means i've gone so many times that i don't even feel the need
      to take pictures. i think their food is super authentic and it also isn't expensive. it's my comfort spot. i rank it a five out of five. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
