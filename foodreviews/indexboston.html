     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%"> i had the chance to visit boston over my spring break 2025, as i have
      friends that go to tufts and harvard. i was able to try a few restaurants that my friends recommended, and i'm excited
      to share!
      <br>
      <br>
      i hope you enjoy! (also please feel free to disagree with me)

     <p><b><h3>üìç: nine tastes, cambridge, ma</h3></b></p>
     <p class = "center" style = "width: 90%"> this was AMAZING. it was close to harvard square and i had the crispy chicken pad thai.
      i thought the price was reasonable and the chicken was amazing (which also came with sauce). the pad thai itself was fragrant and 
      was amazing too. i also got the spring rolls and i felt that they were great too. overall amazing!

     <p><b><h3>üìç: zinneken's waffles, cambridge, ma</h3></b></p>
     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%">amazing dessert spot that specializes in sweet waffles in harvard square.
      this was FANTASTIC. wow. it was also affordable, and the waffle was so warm while the toppings added flavor.
      i would highly recommend this place! <em> *they only have sweet waffles if i remember correctly, there are no savory options.* </em> </p>

     <p><b><h3>üìç: tasty cafe on the hill, medford, ma</h3></b></p>
     <p class="center" style = "width: 90%">this was a brunch place in medford, and my friend said that she hasn't had a bad meal so far from there. 
      and while this was my first place there, i agree. i got the chipotle chicken sandwich and wow, it was delicious. the tea was just brewed from a teabag
      so i would recommend the coffee drinks, as i can most likely make tea myself with the same teabags. however, the tea was still good! </p>
