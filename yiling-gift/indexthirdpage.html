          we both had <l style = "color: brown">moments</l> with dance where we both were so tired but also still
          really appreciated it. honestly, i feel like that's a really common thing with dance, where it's so tiring but at 
          the end of the day, it ends up being super rewarding. i saw you perform at the East Asian culture fest and i wish i went
          up to you and told you that you did amazing!!! i was kind of shy to tell you, but you did great. <3

            you're an INTJ. you actually just inspired me to take the MBTI test again, but i unfortunately
            have a computer science assignment <l style = "color: yellowgreen">AND</l> exam on wednesday so unfortunatley
            i have insufficient funds. <l style = "color: brown">(but the funds are time).</l> however, i will definitely update you on my MBTI afterwards but 
            i feel like i always end up being somewhat swayed by the questions to answer in a way that is most conventionally
            admired LOL...

           your dream job when you were young was to be a teacher. <l style = "color: blue">i find that so admirable. </l> teachers are so underrated
           and underappreciated in our society. on top of that, the patience and empathy that one must possess to be a teacher
           is something that i feel i will always lack, or at least that my progress won't be enough to serve as a teacher. if money wasn't
           a factor, do you think you would still consider being a teacher? i know that teachers are really unfortunately underpaid...
           what subject and grade do you think you would teach too?
