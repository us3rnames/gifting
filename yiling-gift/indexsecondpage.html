          an <l style = "color: red">ideal afternoon </l> for you would be a stroll on nassau. i wonder what your favorite places to visit are on 
          nassau. for me, it would have to be lan ramen and mtea, or honestly, anything down
          witherspoon. i was outside the whole day yesterday and i walked on nassau all the way down
          to <l style = "color: orange">7/11. </l> i had my backpack on me so it was... not fun. honestly, you made me realize
          how little i truly appreciate nassau, especially when the weather's nice. i think similar to
          sentiments that you've previously expressed, i'm beginning to appreciate the environment here
          (now that it's been two years).

            you're an INTJ. you actually just inspired me to take the MBTI test again, but i unfortunately
            have a computer science assignment <l style = "color: yellowgreen">AND</l> exam on wednesday so unfortunatley
            i have insufficient funds. <l style = "color: brown">(but the funds are time).</l> however, i will definitely update you on my MBTI afterwards but 
            i feel like i always end up being somewhat swayed by the questions to answer in a way that is most conventionally
            admired LOL...

           your dream job when you were young was to be a teacher. <l style = "color: blue">i find that so admirable. </l> teachers are so underrated
           and underappreciated in our society. on top of that, the patience and empathy that one must possess to be a teacher
           is something that i feel i will always lack, or at least that my progress won't be enough to serve as a teacher. if money wasn't
           a factor, do you think you would still consider being a teacher? i know that teachers are really unfortunately underpaid...
           what subject and grade do you think you would teach too?
